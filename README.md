# Apple\_Picker



From Chapter 28 in Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development create Apple Picker.



This will be graded on completeness:



The tree should move back and forth in the playing field, changing direction at a random interval and the ends. 10%

The apples should fall directly from the tree (and not off to the side). 10%

The basket should collect the apple and it disappears from the field. 10%

The score should increase on a collection, increasing the high-score as appropriate. 15%

Missing the apple should clear all the apples and remove a bar from the basket. 15%

When all bars are gone from the basket the scene should reset aside from the high score. 15%

An individual add to the game! Make it your own somehow. 25%

Change the look of the elements to your liking.

Add bad apples that must be avoided.

Increasing difficulty over time.

Sound?

Something silly!

Watch out for the use of now deprecated Text in the book, switch to TextMeshPro:



at the top: "using TMPro;"

to fetch the component: "TextMeshProUGUI gt = GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>();"



The submission should be a video of your individualized Apple Picker project. We may ask to review your project in person.



One thing we will not directly review per student but will go over in class is the ability to set a breakpoint in VS Code and trigger it. This will be very useful in your future work and experimenting in this small project will help match VS Code up with Unity.
